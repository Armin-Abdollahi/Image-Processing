You can see the Tutorial video of the Image Processing Filters on my YouTube channel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRVrkqmvTgM&t=2559s

In this video, we will explore the world of image processing filters using MATLAB and Python. We will start by understanding the basics of image processing and how filters can be used to enhance and manipulate images. 

We will then dive into the different types of filters such as Gaussian, Median, and Sobel filters, and learn how to implement them in both MATLAB and Python. We will also discuss the importance of choosing the right filter for specific image processing tasks.

Throughout the video, we will provide step-by-step tutorials on how to apply these filters to real-world images and demonstrate their effects on image quality and features. Additionally, we will compare the results obtained from both MATLAB and Python implementations.

By the end of this video, you will have a solid understanding of image processing filters and be able to confidently apply them to your own projects using either MATLAB or Python. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, this video will provide valuable insights into the world of image processing.

### Gaussian Filter in the Frequency Domain
This repository includes a powerful implementation of the Gaussian filter in the frequency domain, which is an essential technique in image processing for noise reduction and image smoothing. By transforming images into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can apply the Gaussian filter more efficiently.

Explore the code and experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the filtering process!

### Histogram Adjustment

Histogram adjustment is a powerful technique in image processing that enhances the contrast of images by redistributing pixel intensity values. This code implements a histogram equalization algorithm that effectively stretches the range of intensity values, improving the visibility of features in both bright and dark areas of an image. By applying this method, users can achieve a more balanced representation of their images, making it particularly useful for applications in photography, medical imaging, and remote sensing. The implementation is straightforward and can be easily integrated into your projects, allowing for quick adjustments to enhance image quality.
